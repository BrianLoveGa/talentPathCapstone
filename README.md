Recently I was tasked with providing a digital soultion to a global and a local problem. I chose the problem that are simply not enough coders in the world. I have created a site that explores how easy the top languages are to use to manipulate numbers and words. 

There is a tip calculator, a Pig-Latin translator, a rock, paper, scissors game and also a version with lizard and Spock with a scoreboard. There is also a weather API integrated to get a forecast from any major city in the world. Lastly there are dog pictures just for fun. 

This site is desigend to entertain inform and educate. 

I will be releasing videos for each of the sections going in-depth for each one comparing the similarities and differences of how the top three languages handle the same suitation.

Currently there is an embedded video walkthrough of the site.

It was created with responsive css to fit a variety of devices.
